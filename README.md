## Welcome to Critter Quest

This is the temporary home of v2 of Critter Quest which is essentially just the **experimental branch of `github.com/werkn/critter-quest`**.  After it's marked (for an assignment for university) it will move back too **`github.com/werkn/critter-quest` main branch**.

### Tools Needed

For tilemaps I used Tiled which integrates great with Phaser3.  For an IDE I tend to use Vim, but others may find Visual Studio Code easier to use.
